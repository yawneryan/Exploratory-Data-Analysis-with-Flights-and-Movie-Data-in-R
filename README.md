# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Flights-and-Movie-Data-in-R

This project analyzes real-world flight and movie datasets using R and R Markdown, with a focus on data wrangling, relational data validation, visualization, and text analysis. The work explores time-based patterns in flight delays, primary–foreign key relationships in large databases, and links structured data with unstructured movie plot text.

Key analyses include weekly summaries of flight departure delays, validation of relational keys in IMDb-style datasets, joins across multiple data sources, and sentiment analysis of movie plots in relation to ratings.

Highlights of the project:

Analyzed seasonal patterns in flight departure delays using weekly summaries and smoothed visualizations

Built a generic function to validate primary–foreign key relationships between datasets

Explored relational structure and data quality issues in IMDb-style databases

Joined movie metadata with plot summaries and performed sentiment analysis

Created clear visualizations and concise interpretations of results

Tools used:

RStudio

ggplot2, dplyr, tidytext
